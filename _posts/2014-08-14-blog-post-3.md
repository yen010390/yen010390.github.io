In manufacturing, the journey from raw data to tangible results happens when shop-floor processes and digital systems are perfectly synchronized. My focus has been on leveraging SAP as the central nervous system for operations, translating system capabilities into measurable improvements.

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of how I've applied my hands-on knowledge in SAP MM, PP, and PM to deliver value:

| Area | Description | Key Transactions / Tools |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **SAP MM (Materials Management)** | Led a project to digitalize the goods receipt process. Optimized MIGO workflows and ensured real-time stock overview with MMBE. Achieved 50% reduction in supplier wait times and 100% paperless workflow. | MM01 / MM03, MIGO, MMBE |
| **SAP PP (Production Planning)** | Achieved 9% cycle time reduction across 50 machines. Analyzed production order data to identify bottlenecks and standardized parameters in BOMs and Work Centers. | CO01 / CO03, CS01 / CS02, CR01 / CR02 |
| **SAP PM (Plant Maintenance)** | Established a proactive maintenance culture resulting in $10K+ annual savings. Optimized preventive maintenance plans and streamlined maintenance order lifecycle. | IA05, IW21 / IW22, IW31 / IW33 |
| **Automation & Data Integrity** | Developed custom automation tools using Google AppScript and VBA to mass update critical data. Eliminated manual work and reduced error risk. | Google AppScript, VBA |


My goal is always to use the full capabilities of SAP S/4HANA to build transparent, efficient, and continuously improving manufacturing operations. You can see more details and visualizations of these digitalization projects on my portfolio page: yen010390.github.io

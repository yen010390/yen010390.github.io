## Project Description: 
In a group research project, we used Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation to code, model, and simulate a complex assembly process. 
My primary responsibility was to validate the digital model against real-world calculations.

## Key Achievements: 
- Successfully validated the system by rigorously analyzing the theoretical calculation of output and takttime against the simulation's findings, ensuring the model's accuracy for future optimization work.

## Project Description: 
- Led the plant-level deployment and integration of AskDelphi (Speach), a global digital knowledge-sharing platform, to standardize SOPs and training materials.
- The initiative replaced static, text-heavy documents with dynamic, on-demand video tutorials accessible directly on the factory floor via desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

## Key Achievements: 
- Collaborated with the global team to roll out the AskDelphi platform, creating a central repository for expert knowledge and ensuring seamless system integration.
- Converted critical SOPs into accessible, multilingual video "speaches" which drastically reduced training costs (travel, logistics) and accelerated operator onboarding.
- Increased overall productivity by ensuring all employees had on-demand access to the latest procedures, improving skills and operational excellence.

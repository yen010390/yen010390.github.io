## üìÑ Project Description: 
Managed the end-to-end plant training program by analyzing training gaps from operational issues and departmental needs. I developed a comprehensive yearly training plan in collaboration with Quality, EHS, and HR departments to build a skilled and compliant workforce.

## üèÜ Key Achievements: 
- Centralized the employee training masterlist and completely rewrote training materials for clarity and effectiveness.

- Designed and deployed digital training classes and quizzes to automate the collection of training records and ensure comprehension.

- Successfully trained teams on the practical application of Lean principles through hands-on game simulations, proving the program's effectiveness by tracking significant improvements in Production KPIs (OEE, Standard Score).

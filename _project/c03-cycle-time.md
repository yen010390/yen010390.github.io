## Project Description: 
Conducted an optimization project focused on reducing the cycle time for 50 critical VIM (Vertical Injection Molding) machines.

## Key Achievements: 
- Achieved a 9% cycle time improvement (from 16.5s to 15s) by applying statistical analysis (Gauge R&R, histograms, SPC).
- Developed and implemented new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to control parameters and sustain the gains.

## Relevant Skills Demonstrated: 
Statistical Process Control (SPC), Process Validation (IQ/PQ/OQ Principles), SOP Authoring, Lean Manufacturing, Data Analysis.

## Project Description: 
- Conducted an optimization project focused on reducing the cycle time for 50 critical VIM (Vertical Injection Molding) machines.
- Applied statistical analysis (Gauge R&R, histograms, SPC)

## Key Achievements: 
- Achieved a 9% cycle time improvement (from 16.5s to 15s).
- Developed and implemented new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to control parameters and sustain the gains.

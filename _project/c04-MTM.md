## Project Description: 
We conducted a detailed Methods-Time Measurement (MTM) study to analyze and optimize a sub-assembly process, identifying and quantifying all value-added and non-value-added activities.

## Key Achievements: 
- The analysis identified that non-value-adding activities accounted for 28.66% of the throughput time. 
- The subsequent optimized process successfully increased the production rate from 80.68 to 126.98 pieces/hour, a 57% improvement.

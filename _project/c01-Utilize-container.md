## Project Description: 
- Worked with the project team to optimize shipping efficiency for international markets, including LATAM and Thailand.
- Maintain Size/dimensions of products in SAP MM (T-code: MM02)
- Resized product packages and then performed detailed, line-by-line loading simulations for both 20' and 40' containers to develop a new, robust loading process.

## Key Achievements: 
- Increased container utilization to **98%** through the implementation of a new packaging design validated by advanced loading simulations.
- This reduced shipping costs and improved the predictability of international logistics.

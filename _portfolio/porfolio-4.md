# MTM Work & Time Studies

This project involved a detailed Methods-Time Measurement (MTM) study to analyze and optimize a mower handle sub-assembly process. 

## My Role & Key Actions:
Analyzed each process step to define operation times and identify non-value-adding activities, which accounted for over 28% of the throughput time. 
Developed an optimized process flow based on the time study results. 
The resulting optimized process was proven to reduce throughput time by 16.27s and increase the production rate by over 46 pieces per hour. 

## Skills Demonstrated: Time & Motion Study (MTM), Value Stream Mapping, Process Optimization, Bottleneck Analysis.

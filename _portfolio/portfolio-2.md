# Project: Lean & Digitalization Training Program
I designed and delivered a training program for Area Leaders and operators at Colgate Palmolive to build their understanding of Lean and Digitalization concepts. 

## My Role & Key Actions:
Created a hands-on program that used game simulation to teach practical applications of Lean on production lines. 
Designed and implemented a skills assessment system to measure the program's effectiveness. 
Proved the efficiency of the training by tracking improvements in key production KPIs like OEE and Standard Score. 
Skills Demonstrated: Lean Manufacturing, Training & Development, Standardization, Performance Measurement (KPIs), Change Management.

# Project: Assembly Line Simulation & Validation
In a group research project, we used Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation to model, simulate, and validate a complex assembly process. 

## My Role & Key Actions:
My primary responsibility was to validate the system by comparing theoretical calculations with simulation results. 

I focused on analyzing and confirming key metrics like takttime and total output to ensure the model's accuracy. 

## Skills Demonstrated: 
Process Simulation (Siemens Tecnomatix), System Validation, Process Analysis, Takttime Calculation.
